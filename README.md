Hi! I am Yar Zar Junior Java Developer, I am so glad to meet you.

This project was created when I was studying in Java Developer Class(JDC). This project was create by JDC's students and teacher
working to gether like a nice team successfully.

This project is Gold selling.

We used spring framework which is Java Framework. For Security, Spring Security JWT token and for database, MySql database.

>> To run This Backend project => 

open you terminal and creat schema(MySql) => mysql > create database member_db;

Go to the [application.properties] file and modify =>

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/member_db
spring.datasource.username=<your_user_name>
spring.datasource.password=<your_password>

And then run the project. The application will run perfectly! Wonderful

For the front-end we used Angular which is Javascrity framework and bootstrap.
>> Now run the frond end. To run the front-end =>
>> npm install
>> ng server -o
And the The application will live on you default browser. For the next step
>> click the login button
>> userId : admin
